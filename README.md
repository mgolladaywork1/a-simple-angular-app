# A Simple Angular App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

This will be a very simple application made from Angular-CLI 6.  It contains only a title and one input field.

**Note:** As of 06/23/2018, you may get a warning from Github regarding security issue.  That is due to some dependency from karma.  Some experts in the community is working on the fix.  Once the fix is released, we will update this project 


This project assume that you have [Git Bash] installed in your pc.  if you don’t, please install [Git Bash] first.  

To start creating the application, you will have to have Angular-CLI installed globally.  If you don’t, please do:
